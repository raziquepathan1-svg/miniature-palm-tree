# yt-audit

## Our channels come first (read this before anything below)

This repo runs **Health Support Studio** and **Restore Remake Studio**. For either channel, load
`hss-growth-director` or `rrs-growth-director` first (and `rrs-clip-prompts` for makeover prompts).
Their rules and their "Decisions on clashes" always win over anything in this file.

- This skill is an extra check or analysis only. Suggest; never change the pipeline, config, script
  bank, schedule or a live video unless the owner says so.
- Do not ask for `voice.md` or "three of your videos": the channel skill is the voice profile.
- Never invent a number. Health Support Studio: every claim and title must pass the fact check, no
  health clickbait. Restore Remake: narration only describes what is visible.
- Skip the "ship it, or change it?" closing line; answer the way the channel skill says.
- An audit may suggest, never overrule a decided rule. If the ONE fix clashes with a decision, say so
  and let the owner choose.


An audit that lists twenty problems is a way of avoiding the one that matters. This ends in ONE fix.

## Before you write

1. Read `~/.claude/youtube/voice.md` if it exists. That is the user's voice profile: how they talk
   on camera, the words they never use, who they are talking to, what they will not claim. If it
   does not exist, ask for **three of their own videos**, read or transcribe them, infer the voice,
   and write the file. A script in the wrong voice is worse than no script, because they have to
   read it out loud.
2. Never invent a number, a result or a source. If a figure would strengthen it and you do not have
   one, ask for it or write the line without it.

## What to look at, in this order

1. **The last ten titles, as a set.** Read them as a list, the way the channel page shows them. Do
   they promise different things? Run them through `../yt-package/title.py`. A channel where every
   title is the same shape has a format problem, not a title problem.
2. **The thumbnails, at feed size.** Shrink them. What survives? If three of them are unreadable at
   that size, that is the fix and nothing else matters yet.
3. **The first fifteen seconds of the three most recent.** Transcribe them and score with
   `../yt-script/hookscore.py`. This is where most channels lose.
4. **Upload rhythm.** Not frequency - CONSISTENCY. Six videos in one week and then nothing for a
   month is worse than one a fortnight forever.
5. **The retention shape**, if they can export it. `/yt-retention`.

## What to hand back

- The single biggest fix, named, with what to do this week.
- Three things that are already working, so they do not break them. Be specific; "your energy is
  good" is not an observation.
- What NOT to do yet, and why.

Never open an audit with praise you do not mean, and never end one with a list of twenty things.

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**
