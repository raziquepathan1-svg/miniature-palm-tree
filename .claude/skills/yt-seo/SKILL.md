# yt-seo

## Our channels come first (read this before anything below)

This repo runs **Health Support Studio** and **Restore Remake Studio**. For either channel, load
`hss-growth-director` or `rrs-growth-director` first (and `rrs-clip-prompts` for makeover prompts).
Their rules and their "Decisions on clashes" always win over anything in this file.

- This skill is an extra check or analysis only. Suggest; never change the pipeline, config, script
  bank, schedule or a live video unless the owner says so.
- Do not ask for `voice.md` or "three of your videos": the channel skill is the voice profile.
- Never invent a number. Health Support Studio: every claim and title must pass the fact check, no
  health clickbait. Restore Remake: narration only describes what is visible.
- Skip the "ship it, or change it?" closing line; answer the way the channel skill says.
- Description order is fixed: 2 keyword lines first, then "Watch next", then the series line (HSS);
  keyword line then the Day line (RRS).


Search is a smaller lever than packaging and a bigger one than people think for evergreen videos.
For a video aimed at the subscriber feed, say so and spend the effort on `/yt-package` instead.

## Before you write

1. Read `~/.claude/youtube/voice.md` if it exists. That is the user's voice profile: how they talk
   on camera, the words they never use, who they are talking to, what they will not claim. If it
   does not exist, ask for **three of their own videos**, read or transcribe them, infer the voice,
   and write the file. A script in the wrong voice is worse than no script, because they have to
   read it out loud.
2. Never invent a number, a result or a source. If a figure would strengthen it and you do not have
   one, ask for it or write the line without it.

## The description

- **The first two lines are the only ones anyone reads.** They show above "...more" and they are
  the search snippet. Say what the video gives them, in the words they would have typed.
- Then the link or the resource, if there is one, so it is above the fold.
- Then chapters (`/yt-chapters` writes them).
- Then the long version: what is covered, who it is for, what it assumes.

## Tags, honestly

Tags are a weak signal and YouTube has said so. Use them for disambiguation - spellings, the tool
names, the abbreviations people actually type - and stop. Fifteen is plenty. A wall of tags is not
a strategy and stuffing unrelated ones is against the terms.

## The query test

Before handing anything over, write the three search queries this video should win, and check the
title and first two description lines contain the words in those queries. If they do not, the
problem is the title, not the description.

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**
